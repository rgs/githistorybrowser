git history browser for vim
---------------------------

Installation
------------

Put githistorybrowser.vim in your ~/.vim directory,
and load it (by hand or in your .vimrc) with
    :run githistorybrowser.vim
For nicer output you can also copy the syntax/* files in your
~/.vim/syntax directory.

Usage
-----

The new macros installed are (assuming for this example that
your map local leader is "_") :

In normal mode :
  _b will open a blame window
  _l will open a log window

In visual mode :
  _b will open a blame window, restricted to the lines currently selected

In the blame window:
  _g or a double click will display blame for the file at the time of the
     penultimate (or first) change for the current line
  _h will go back to displaying blame up until HEAD
  _d will open a new window with the change responsible for the current line
  _l will open a log window (with the full log for the file)

In a diff window:
  _g or a double click will go to the blame of the file whose path is under
     the cursor, at the time of the diff. (this will work better if your repo's
     root dir is in the 'path' option)

In a log window:
  _d or a double click will jump to the diff where the cursor currently is
